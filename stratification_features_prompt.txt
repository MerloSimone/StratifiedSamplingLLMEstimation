Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meanings:
0 = represent that the passage has nothing to do with the query,
1 = represents that the passage seems related to the query but does not answer it,
2 = represents that the passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information and
3 = represents that the passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.

Important Instruction: Assign category 1 if the passage is somewhat related to the topic but not completely, category 2 if passage presents something very important related to the entire topic but also has some extra information and category 3 if the passage only and entirely refers to the topic. If none of the above satisfies give it category 0.

Query: {query}
Passage: {passage}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query.
Measure how trustworthy the passage is.
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score. Final score must be an integer value only.
Do not provide any code in result, just the final score.

The final score is:
